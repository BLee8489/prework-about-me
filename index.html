      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'd say it started back in 2004 and 2005 back in the MySpace days, I'd love being able to customize my own page with coding. Fast forward to now, I work for a technology based real estate company, and having to become an expert on our tools, has striked my interest even more for both front end and back end.</p>
